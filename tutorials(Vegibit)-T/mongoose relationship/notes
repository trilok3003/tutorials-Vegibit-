Weâ€™ll have a look at Reference Based Relationships (Normalization)
 as well as Embedded Documents Relationships (Denormalization).

 Normalization -> Better Consistency
Requires additional queries
Provides Consistency
  examples:
  

let publisher = {
    companyName: 'Nintendo'
}
let game = {
    publisher: 'id'
}

Denormalization -> Better Performance
Can use a single query for related documents
Consistency can degrade over time

let game = {
    publisher: {
        companyName: 'Nintendo'
    }
}
